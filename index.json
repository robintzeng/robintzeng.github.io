The local pathway aims to extract high-resolution features, and it is made up of 2D block, which is illustrated in Fig. 2(b). The global pathway extracts low-resolution features, and it comprises our proposed U-Block, as shown in Fig. 2(a). The structure of the pathway is illistrated in Fig 3.\nAlso, we improve the performance of the local pathway by concatenating binary mask to the sparse LiDAR data, because the binary mask can help our model to indicate the valid values of sparse LiDAR data.\nFinally, to combine the results of the local and global pathways, we apply the attention mechanism (confidence map) to integrate the predicted dense from two pathways.\n        ","date":1585267200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585267200,"objectID":"32afb1efea5459606844e8bd6b4cd8c4","permalink":"https://robintzeng.github.io/project/cv/","publishdate":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/cv/","section":"project","summary":"Depth completion is the technique of estimating a dense depth image from sparse depth measurements.","tags":["Depth Completion"],"title":"Depth Completion","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Abstract This project aims to adapt an open source visual inertial navigation framework with two modifications. First, an alternative visual descriptor and extractor, SuperPoint, is tested in place of ORB features. Secondly, an invariant error state is implemented in order to more effectively track the IMU pose uncertainty while maintaining the visual feature correction step in a ”dual track” system. Each of these changes is evaluated separately on three datasets obtained from the EuRoC MAV dataset.
